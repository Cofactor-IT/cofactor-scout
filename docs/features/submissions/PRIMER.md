## Tips for Strong Submissions

1. **Be specific** - "AI for drug discovery" is better than "AI research"
2. **Explain the impact** - Why does this matter? Who benefits?
3. **Show traction** - Publications, grants, partnerships
4. **Know the researcher** - Personal connection adds credibility
5. **Commercial potential** - How could this become a business?
6. **Be honest** - Don't oversell or make up information

## What We're Looking For

**Strong indicators:**
- Novel approach to important problem
