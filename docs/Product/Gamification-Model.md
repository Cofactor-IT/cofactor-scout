# Gamification Model

We use game design elements to motivate students to contribute high-quality data.

## Power Score
The "Power Score" is the central currency of reputation. It is **not** spendable; it is a permanent record of contribution.

| Action | Points | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Referral** | +50 | Growth is our #1 priority. Bringing a friend is the highest value action. |
| **Wiki Edit** | +20 | Creating knowledge adds long-term value. (Awarded *only* on approval). |
| **Social Link** | +10 | Connecting Instagram/LinkedIn verifies identity and builds the network. |

## Leaderboards
Top contributors are displayed on the university leaderboard.
*   **Weekly**: "Who is active right now?"
*   **All-Time**: "Who are the legends of this university?"

## Incentives
Why do students care about points?
1.  **Status**: High score = "Campus Insider".
2.  **Access**: Future features (like Job Boards or exclusive events) will be gated by Power Score.
3.  **Recruiting**: Labs looking for research assistants will prioritize students with high scores (proof of engagement and knowledge).
