# Platform Overview

## Our Mission
**Cofactor Club** exists to create a decentralized, student-driven knowledge base for universities. We believe that the most valuable information about academic life—which labs are hiring, which professors are approachable, which institutes are cutting-edge—often lives in silos. Our platform breaks those silos.

## Core Value Props

### 1. For Students
*   **Transparency**: Find out what's really happening in labs and institutes.
*   **Recognition**: Earn a "Power Score" and reputation for contributing knowledge.
*   **Connection**: Network with other ambitious students and get discovered by labs.

### 2. For Universities
*   **Centralized Knowledge**: A living, breathing directory of people and research.
*   **Student Engagement**: A gamified way to keep students interacting with academic content.

## How It Works

1.  **Sign Up**: Students sign up with their university email (e.g., `alice@tu-berlin.de`).
2.  **Verify**: The system automatically verifies the domain and places them in their university's private wiki.
3.  **Contribute**: Students browse the wiki. If they see missing or outdated info, they click "Edit".
4.  **Earn**: Every approved edit earns points. Points unlock status and rewards.

## Key Features

*   **University-Specific Wikis**: Each university has its own isolated space.
*   **Mention System**: Tag people and labs directly in text (like Twitter/Slack).
*   **Mobile-First Design**: Fully functional on smartphones for students on the go.
*   **Privacy-First**: Public vs. Private profile settings.
