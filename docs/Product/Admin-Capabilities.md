# Admin Capabilities

Admins have a dedicated **Dashboard** to oversee the platform's health and safety.

## 1. Analytics & KPIs
At a glance, Admins can see:
*   **Total Users**: Growth rate.
*   **Active Referrals**: Viral coefficient.
*   **Pending Edits**: Backlog size for moderation.
*   **Social Reach**: Aggregate follower count of all members.

## 2. University Management
Admins can launch the platform at a new university in seconds.
*   **Add University**: Input Name (e.g., "MIT") and Domain (e.g., "mit.edu").
*   **Email Whitelist**: The system immediately starts accepting signups from that domain.

## 3. User Controls
*   **Banning**: Block malicious users by email or IP.
*   **Role Promotion**: Manually promote a Student to Staff if they apply and are vetted.
*   **Impersonation**: (Dev only) View the site as a specific user to debug issues.

## 4. System Health
*   **Feature Flags**: Turn features on/off globally (e.g., "Disable Signups" during maintenance).
*   **Backups**: Trigger manual database backups before major updates.
