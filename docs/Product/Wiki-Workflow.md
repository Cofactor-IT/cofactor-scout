# The Wiki Workflow

Unlike Wikipedia, where anyone can edit anything immediately, Cofactor Club uses a **Staged Contribution Model** to ensure quality.

## The Cycle of Knowledge

### Step 1: Proposal
A Student notices that "Professor Smith's" profile is missing their latest research paper. They click **Edit**, add the info, and hit **Submit**.
*   *Status*: `PENDING`
*   *Visibility*: Hidden from the public. Visible to Staff in the "Queue".

### Step 2: Moderation
A Staff member (or Admin) gets a notification. They open the **Diff Viewer**, which shows exactly what changed (Green for added text, Red for removed).
*   *Action*: The Moderator clicks **Approve**.

### Step 3: Publication
The system merges the changes into the live page.
*   *Status*: `APPROVED` (Published)
*   *Visibility*: Visible to everyone at the university.
*   *Reward*: The Student gets +20 Power Score.

## Handling Disputes

If a Moderator rejects an edit:
1.  They must provide a **Reason** (e.g., "Factually incorrect", "Spam", "Formatting").
2.  The Student gets a notification with the feedback.
3.  The Student can fix the issue and resubmit.

## Automatic Trust
"Trusted Users" skip Step 2 for small changes. This keeps the wiki moving fast while preventing mass vandalism.
